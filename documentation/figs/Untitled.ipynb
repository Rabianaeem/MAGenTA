    "MAGenTA is a command-line based tool for Transposon Insertion Sequencing (Tn-Seq) data analysis. It was developed to analyze data generated by the method outlined in [van Opijnen 2009](http://www.nature.com/nmeth/journal/v6/n10/abs/nmeth.1377.html), which unlike other transposon insertion sequencing methods (cite here), assesses organismal fitness by profiling the mutant library at two time points, typically before and after a challenge (i.e. an antibiotic) is presented. The MAGenTA pipeline tools differ from other Tn-Seq analysis tools in that they perform comparative analyses that include this fitness measurement, rather than only looking at insertion representation.\n",

    "***\n",
    "\n",
    "The method for calculating the aggregate fitness value of a gene relies on the genomic start and end coordinates of the region, which is retrievable from the organism’s Genbank record. However, not all official genome records are complete or well annotated beyond genes. At the same time, it has been shown that non-coding RNAs have an important role in virulence and other functions. Therefore, to enable discovery of such regions that may have an important fitness value to the organism, this tools uses a  sliding window approach to mine Tn-Seq data in a non-gene-centric manner. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Determining window size and step\n",
    "The entire genome and ordered Tn-Seq data is scanned by performing assessments of regions at a set size (base pair length of window) and step (base pairs between the start of each window). Based on the genome used, typically a window size between 250 bp and 500 bp is small enough to pick up intergenic regions or gene domains but large enough to contain enough TA sites and insertions. However, this can vary depending on organism and insertion density. The DataOverview tool can help determine these factors.\n",
    "</break>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Method\n",
    "In each regional profile, the aggregate fitness cost for insertions and the insertion representation in that region is calculated. To assess insertion representation, we follow the method used by Zhang et. al.14. For a given region, with x insertions and n TA sites, 10,000 random sets of n TA sites are selected and the average of insertions over TA sites is calculated for each. The 10,000 resulting means create a null distribution. The p-value can be derived for the original region of interest by ranking it on the distribution for x/n. A statistically underrepresented number of insertions for a region will be significant if the p-value is below the critical value. Gene annotations are also recorded if they are contained in the region. In the future, a function to identify promoter regions based on -10 and -35 box sequences and domain regions will be useful. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run time\n",
    "SlidingWindow performs the fitness and insertion representation assessments in approximately 8 minutes for a two-thousand base pair genome with ~70% TA site saturation. For the Tn-Seq data from two strains of Streptococcus pneumoniae grown in two conditions, 211,151 regions (300 bp) across the 2,112,148 bp genome were profiled using this approach and later used for comparative analyses. \n",

For the main data track, multiple library files containing the insertion coordinates and fitness values are aggregated to produce a file containing unique insertions with a single fitness value using the SingleFit tool. For the annotation track, gene coordinates, transcription direction, and id are extracted from the Genbank record using the GetGeneFeatures tool and features specifically formatted for Gviz input.  Finally, the sequence track accepts the genome fasta file. Once these three files are uploaded in Rstudio, the customized Tn-Seq functions can be used to visualize regions by gene id or start and end coordinates with at most two experiments in the same window (Fig.3). \n",
