#### Types of example files included here:
1. Barcode files (e.g. trim1-bc.txt). See manual for more details.
2. Genome files for TIGR4 and Taiwan-19F Streptococcus pneumoniae strains. These correspond to data files in (3).
3. Four sets of data files for 2 strains (TIGR4 and Taiwan-19F) in two experimental conditions: glucose and glucose+daptomycin (simply referred to as "daptomycin"). Each set contains 6 Calculate Fitness results files for the 6 replicate libraries and 1 Single Fitness results file which is an aggregate of the 6 libraries for that strain + condition. 

More details on files and file usage are included within the data/ and genome/ directories.
